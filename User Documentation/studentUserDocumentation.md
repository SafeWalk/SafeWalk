<b>SafeWalk is a mobile app that allows students to contact safewalk with only a touch of a button. No more embarrassing phone calls to safewalk. Just open the app, press the large button and safewalk will be on its way.</b> <br>
Upon first installing the app, you will be greeted with our logo. Swipe left to read a little about us as the people who brought you this app. Swipe left again to get started. Once you press the “get started” button, you won’t have to revisit the previous panels again. You will be asked to input your name and phone number. You can change this information in the “settings” menu.

<b>How will safewalk know where to pick me up?</b>
You have three options to inform safewalk of your location. 1.) Choose a campus building from the drop-down menu. This is recommended if you are on campus. 2.) Choose the “custom location” option from the drop-down menu and manually type in the address. 3.) Choose the “current location” option from the drop-down menu. The app will display your current location based
on GPS or by using cell towers. This is recommended if you are off campus and are outside.

<b>Why does the large button change colors?</b>
Safewalk is able to inform you of their “status” by changing the color and text of the large button in the center of the screen. Green means safewalk is ready, yellow means that there are no available walkers currently, and red means that safewalk is unavailable.

<b>How often can I send a request to safewalk?</b><br>
You can send a request to safewalk every 20 minutes.

<b>How accurate is the “current location” option?</b>
The “current location” option will display a street address if the accuracy is less than 100 meters. If the accuracy is more than 100 meters a message will be displayed notifying you that your location cannot be accurately captured.
